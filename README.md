# Customer-Churn-Analysis
Customer Churn Analysis using EDA and visualization. Explores key factors driving churn such as tenure, contract type, services, and payment methods. Insights highlight that long-term contracts, bundled services, and targeted retention strategies can reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.
ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Analysis

This project provides an in-depth analysis of customer churn with a focus on identifying the key factors that influence customer retention and service discontinuation. Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges faced by subscription-based businesses, especially in the telecommunications sector, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

Using the provided dataset, this project applies exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques to uncover meaningful insights about customer behavior, demographics, and service usage patterns. The primary objective is to understand why customers leave and to provide actionable strategies for reducing churn.

ðŸ”Ž Key Insights

The overall churn rate is 26.54%, highlighting a significant risk area.

Senior citizens show higher churn rates compared to younger customers, suggesting the need for targeted engagement strategies.

Tenure plays a critical role: customers with short tenures (1â€“2 months) churn at much higher rates, while long-term customers remain loyal.

Contract type strongly influences retention: month-to-month customers are the most likely to churn, whereas those with 1-year or 2-year contracts show greater stability.

Customers with services such as Phone Service, Internet Service, and Online Security enabled are more likely to stay, while churn is higher among those lacking Online Backup, Tech Support, or Streaming TV.

Payment methods also matterâ€”customers using electronic payment methods tend to have higher churn rates.

ðŸŽ¯ Business Value

The findings from this analysis can directly inform retention strategies. Businesses can:

Introduce onboarding programs to reduce early-stage churn.

Provide discounts or incentives for customers to adopt longer-term contracts.

Bundle and promote value-added services like Online Security and Backup to increase stickiness.

Develop special campaigns for senior citizens and high-risk groups.

Reassess electronic payment experiences to address potential friction points.

ðŸ“ˆ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data-driven insights can guide proactive customer retention efforts. By addressing key churn drivers, companies can not only improve customer satisfaction but also strengthen long-term profitability.
